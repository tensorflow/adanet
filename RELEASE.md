# Current version (0.7.0.dev)
 * Under development.
 * TODO: Add official Keras Model support, including Keras layers, Sequential, and Model subclasses for defining subnetworks.
 * Train the current iteration forever when `max_iteration_steps=None`.
 * Introduce `adanet.AutoEnsembleSubestimator` for training subestimators on different training data partitions and implement ensemble methods like bootstrap aggregating (a.k.a bagging).
 * Fix bug when using Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Estimators with `AutoEnsembleEstimator` during distributed training.
 * Allow `AutoEnsembleEstimator's` `candidate_pool` argument to be a `lambda` in order to create `Estimators` lazily.
 * Remove `adanet.subnetwork.Builder#prune_previous_ensemble` for abstract class. This behavior is now specified using `adanet.ensemble.Strategy` subclasses.
 * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Only support TensorFlow >= 1.13 to better support TensorFlow 2.0. Drop support for versions < 1.13.
 * Correct eval metric computations on CPU and GPU.

# Release 0.6.2
 * Fix n+1 global-step increment bug in `adanet.AutoEnsembleEstimator`. This bug incremented the global_step by n+1 for n canned `Estimators` like `DNNEstimator`.

# Release 0.6.1
 * Maintain compatibility with TensorFlow versions >=1.9.

# Release 0.6.0
 * Officially support AdaNet on TPU using `adanet.TPUEstimator` with `adanet.Estimator` feature parity.
 * Support dictionary candidate pools in `adanet.AutoEnsembleEstimator` constructor to specify human-readable candidate names.
 * Improve AutoEnsembleEstimator ability to handling custom `tf.estimator.Estimator` subclasses.
 * Introduce `adanet.ensemble` which contains interfaces and examples of ways to learn ensembles using AdaNet. Users can now extend AdaNet to use custom ensemble-learning methods.
 * Record TensorBoard `scalar`, `image`, `histogram`, and `audio` summaries on TPU during training.
 * Add debug mode to help detect NaNs and Infs during training.
 * Improve subnetwork `tf.train.SessionRunHook` support to handle more edge cases.
 * ~~Maintain compatibility with TensorFlow versions 1.9 thru 1.13~~ Only works for TensorFlow version >=1.13.
 * Improve documentation including adding 'Getting Started' documentation to [adanet.readthedocs.io](http://adanet.readthedocs.io).
 * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Importing the `adanet.subnetwork` package using `from adanet.core import subnetwork` will no longer work, because the package was moved to the `adanet/subnetwork` directory. Most users should already be using `adanet.subnetwork` or `from adanet import subnetwork`, and should not be affected.

# Release 0.5.0
 * Support training on TPU using `adanet.TPUEstimator`.
 * Allow subnetworks to specify `tf.train.SessionRunHook` instances for training with `adanet.subnetwork.TrainOpSpec`.
 * Add API documentation generation with Sphinx.
 * Fix bug preventing subnetworks with Resource variables from working beyond the first iteration.

# Release 0.4.0
 * Add `shared` field to `adanet.Subnetwork` to deprecate, replace, and be more flexible than `persisted_tensors`.
 * Officially support multi-head learning with or without dict labels.
 * Rebuild the ensemble across iterations in Python without a frozen graph. This allows users to share more than `Tensors` between iterations including Python primitives, objects, and lambdas for greater flexibility. Eliminating reliance on a `MetaGraphDef` proto also eliminates I/O allowing for faster training, and better future-proofing.
 * Allow users to pass custom eval metrics when constructing an `adanet.Estimator`.
 * Add `adanet.AutoEnsembleEstimator` for learning to ensemble `tf.estimator.Estimator` instances.
 * Pass labels to `adanet.subnetwork.Builder`'s `build_subnetwork` method.
 * The TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection will only contain variables relevant to the current `adanet.subnetwork.Builder`, so not passing `var_list` to the `optimizer.minimize` will lead to the same behavior as passing it in by default.
 * Using `tf.summary` inside `adanet.subnetwork.Builder` is now equivalent to using the `adanet.Summary` object.
 * Accessing the `global_step` from within an `adanet.subnetwork.Builder` will return the `iteration_step` variable instead, so that the step starts at zero at the beginning of each iteration. One subnetwork incrementing the step will not affect other subnetworks.
 * Summaries will automatically scope themselves to the current subnetwork's scope. Similar summaries will now be correctly grouped together correctly across subnetworks in TensorBoard. This eliminates the need for the `tf.name_scope("")` hack.
 * Provide an override to force the AdaNet ensemble to grow at the end of each iteration.
 * Correctly seed TensorFlow graph between iterations. This breaks some tests that check the outputs of `adanet.Estimator` models.

# Release 0.3.0
 * Add official support for `tf.keras.layers`.
 * Fix bug that incorrectly pruned colocation constraints between iterations.

# Release 0.2.0
 * Estimator no longer creates eval metric ops in train mode.
 * Freezer no longer converts Variables to constants, allowing AdaNet to handle Variables larger than 2GB.
 * Fixes some errors with Python 3.

# Release 0.1.0
 * Initial AdaNet release.

## Requirements
 * tf-nightly>=1.9.0.dev20180601 || tensorflow>=1.9.0rc0
