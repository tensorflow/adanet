class Estimator(tf.estimator.Estimator):
  # pyformat: disable
  r"""A :class:`tf.estimator.Estimator` for training, evaluation, and serving.

  This implementation uses an :class:`adanet.subnetwork.Generator` as its weak
  learning algorithm for generating candidate subnetworks. These are trained in
  parallel using a single graph per iteration. At the end of each iteration, the
  estimator saves the sub-graph of the best subnetwork ensemble and its weights
  as a separate checkpoint. At the beginning of the next iteration, the
  estimator imports the previous iteration's frozen graph and adds ops for the
  next candidates as part of a new graph and session. This allows the estimator
  have the performance of Tensorflow's static graph constraint (minus the
  performance hit of reconstructing a graph between iterations), while having
  the flexibility of having a dynamic graph.

  NOTE: Subclassing :class:`tf.estimator.Estimator` is only necessary to work
  with :meth:`tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` which asserts that the estimator
  argument is a :class:`tf.estimator.Estimator` subclass. However, all training
  is delegated to a separate :class:`tf.estimator.Estimator` instance. It is
  responsible for supporting both local and distributed training. As such, the
  :class:`adanet.Estimator` is only responsible for bookkeeping across
  iterations.

  Args:
    head: A :class:`tf.contrib.estimator.Head` instance for computing loss and
      evaluation metrics for every candidate.
    subnetwork_generator: The :class:`adanet.subnetwork.Generator` which defines
      the candidate subnetworks to train and evaluate at every AdaNet iteration.
    max_iteration_steps: Total number of steps for which to train candidates per
      iteration. If :class:`OutOfRange` or :class:`StopIteration` occurs in the
      middle, training stops before `max_iteration_steps` steps. When
      :code:`None`, it will train the current iteration forever.
    ensemblers: An iterable of :class:`adanet.ensemble.Ensembler` objects that
      define how to ensemble a group of subnetworks.
    ensemble_strategies: An iterable of :class:`adanet.ensemble.Strategy`
      objects that define the candidate ensembles of subnetworks to explore at
      each iteration.
    evaluator: An :class:`adanet.Evaluator` for candidate selection after all
      subnetworks are done training. When :code:`None`, candidate selection uses
      a moving average of their :class:`adanet.Ensemble` AdaNet loss during
      training instead. In order to use the *AdaNet algorithm* as described in
      [Cortes et al., '17], the given :class:`adanet.Evaluator` must be created
      with the same dataset partition used during training. Otherwise, this
      framework will perform *AdaNet.HoldOut* which uses a holdout set for
      candidate selection, but does not benefit from learning guarantees.
    report_materializer: An :class:`adanet.ReportMaterializer`. Its reports are
      made available to the `subnetwork_generator` at the next iteration, so
      that it can adapt its search space. When `None`, the
      `subnetwork_generator` :meth:`generate_candidates` method will receive
      empty Lists for their `previous_ensemble_reports` and `all_reports`
      arguments.
    metric_fn: A function for adding custom evaluation metrics, which should
      obey the following signature:
        - `Args`:
          Can only have the following three arguments in any order:
          - :code:`predictions`: Predictions `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor`
            created by given :code:`head`.
          - :code:`features`: Input `dict` of `Tensor` objects created by
            :code:`input_fn` which is given to :meth:`estimator.evaluate` as an
            argument.
          - :code:`labels`: Labels `Tensor` or dict of `Tensor` (for multi-head)
            created by :code:`input_fn` which is given to
            :meth:`estimator.evaluate` as an argument.
        - `Returns`: Dict of metric results keyed by name. Final metrics are a
          union of this and :code:`head`'s existing metrics. If there is a name
          conflict between this and :code:`head`s existing metrics, this will
          override the existing one. The values of the dict are the results of
          calling a metric function, namely a :code:`(metric_tensor, update_op)`
          tuple.
    force_grow: Boolean override that forces the ensemble to grow by one
      subnetwork at the end of each iteration. Normally at the end of each
      iteration, AdaNet selects the best candidate ensemble according to its
      performance on the AdaNet objective. In some cases, the best ensemble is
      the `previous_ensemble` as opposed to one that includes a newly trained
      subnetwork. When `True`, the algorithm will not select the
      `previous_ensemble` as the best candidate, and will ensure that after n
      iterations the final ensemble is composed of n subnetworks.
    replicate_ensemble_in_training: Whether to rebuild the frozen subnetworks of
      the ensemble in training mode, which can change the outputs of the frozen
      subnetworks in the ensemble. When `False` and during candidate training,
      the frozen subnetworks in the ensemble are in prediction mode, so
      training-only ops like dropout are not applied to them. When `True` and
      training the candidates, the frozen subnetworks will be in training mode
      as well, so they will apply training-only ops like dropout.  This argument
      is useful for regularizing learning mixture weights, or for making
      training-only side inputs available in subsequent iterations. For most
      use-cases, this should be `False`.
    adanet_loss_decay: Float decay for the exponential-moving-average of the
      AdaNet objective throughout training. This moving average is a data-
      driven way tracking the best candidate with only the training set.
    delay_secs_per_worker: Float number of seconds to delay starting the
      i-th worker. Staggering worker start-up during distributed asynchronous
      SGD can improve training stability and speed up convergence. Each worker
      will wait (i+1) * delay_secs_per_worker seconds before beginning training.
    max_worker_delay_secs: Float max number of seconds to delay starting the
      i-th worker. Staggering worker start-up during distributed asynchronous
      SGD can improve training stability and speed up convergence. Each worker
      will wait up to max_worker_delay_secs before beginning training.
    worker_wait_secs: Float number of seconds for workers to wait before
      checking if the chief prepared the next iteration.
    worker_wait_timeout_secs: Float number of seconds for workers to wait for
      chief to prepare the next iteration during distributed training. This is
      needed to prevent workers waiting indefinitely for a chief that may have
      crashed or been turned down. When the timeout is exceeded, the worker
      exits the train loop. In situations where the chief job is much slower
      than the worker jobs, this timeout should be increased.
    model_dir: Directory to save model parameters, graph and etc. This can also
      be used to load checkpoints from the directory into a estimator to
      continue training a previously saved model.
    report_dir: Directory where the
      :class:`adanet.subnetwork.MaterializedReport`s materialized by
      :code:`report_materializer` would be saved. If :code:`report_materializer`
      is :code:`None`, this will not save anything. If :code:`None` or
      empty string, defaults to :code:`<model_dir>/report`.
    config: :class:`RunConfig` object to configure the runtime settings.
    debug: Boolean to enable debug mode which will check features and labels
      for Infs and NaNs.
    **kwargs: Extra keyword args passed to the parent.

  Returns:
    An :class:`adanet.Estimator` instance.

  Raises:
    :code:`ValueError`: If :code:`ensemblers` is size > 1.
    :code:`ValueError`: If :code:`subnetwork_generator` is :code:`None`.
    :code:`ValueError`: If :code:`max_iteration_steps` is <= 0.
    :code:`ValueError`: If :code:`model_dir` is not specified during distributed
      training.
